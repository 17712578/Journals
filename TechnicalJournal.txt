The drivers have a speed range of 20,000 to -20000.
Normally 7 variables are linked to one platform

Problems
	PE034 is not built in to the system
	Header file cannot be found
	Reflective memory is not connected to the embedded server

The driver manaul
-The driver contains API functions that enable you to
	Open and close the driver
	Configure the board
	Transfer data 
	Control/handle interrupts events
- When writing code
	The first step is to open the driver
	You can call RFM2gErrorMsg() function with the error to retrieve a description of the error code
	Byte swapping may be required due to different systems requiring Big Endian & Little Endian

-To convert a decimal from a variable back in ascii
	Decimal => hexdecimal => break into two individual bytes => compare against ascii table
- My first Task is
	To write some code that will load a pallet on to platform 21 and then have the platform move the
	pallet 23 & 24, which centres the pallet over the coilcar lifter.  
	Functions required are RFM2gPoke32, STDRFM2GCALL and a delay loop as we are unable to read the LEDs yet

-First task is all most complete, just need to adjust timing as the Leds are not impleted as variables yet
