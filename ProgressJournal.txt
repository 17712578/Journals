•	Had Teleco meeting with Peter, Dr. Thomas Kuhn and Ash
•	Signed contracts, roughly 8 hours per day required, I have copy for myself and the university.
•	Met my demonstrator ‘Zia Zhang’ we will be working on the BaSys40 project together.
•	Went to the downstairs lab, learnt how to power up and shut down the severs
•	Used Putty to start up Mat Lab equations on the server, then displayed the full factory layout on TV
•	The aim of this project is to move the Aluminum Coils around the factory.
•	Was able to manually move the coils and also change speed and direction.
09/03/2017
•	Read the factory manual, translated some German names of the factory into English.
•	In the future the factory may advance to a stage where the coils are rolled out. This rolling process is critical, as thickness, temperature, and number of remaining stitches must be taken into consideration when rolling the Aluminum. 
•	Read the driver manual, See technical journal for details.
•	Discovered which variables are linked to the Platforms, Coil car and Coil lifter.
•	Still unable to find how to move the slide platform, read LED variables and move the Coil Car.
10/03/2017
•	Worked out how to convert the Pallet Name and Location into a decimal number using the Ascii table.
•	Started working out different numbers required to hardcode.
•	Tested some of these numbers by manually entering them into the machine, successfully booked in a pallet and moved it in both directions
•	Started writing code so it ready to test next week. 


13/03/2017
•	Today the reflective memory got connected to the embedded server, which allows compiling of C programs on the embedded server
•	More variables were also added to the system in a update from SMS group.
•	Compiled the prepared code from last week, only a couple of errors.
•	Fixed the code and successfully executed it, A pallet was loaded into the system and moved across the platform.
14/03/2017
•	Inspected house today and the new accommodation is sorted.
•	Today's task was to make my code more efficient, both versions shall be kept in the technical journal
•	Had an error in the Byte Swap Function that was still unsolved at the end of the day.
15/03/2017
•	Solved the error in the Byte Swap Function and merged the function into the main code
•	Another problem arose when we tried to compile it in the Lab, apparently the machine runs on C89 and not C99 forcing us to make some minor adjustments.
•	Eventually this was sorted and a pallet was loaded into the system, this time the name and location was determined by typing it into CMD on the machine rather than the laptop.
•	Turned on a platform and stopped it after a certain amount of time, a couple of minor timing adjustments will result in the pallet stopping in the correct place.
16/03/2017
•	Today Dr. Kuhn promised us Football tickets to the FC Kaiserslautern game.
•	Was notified people are coming from Tokyo to see our factory in April 24th 
•	Fixed the timing adjustments from yesterday, now the pallet moves into the correct position ready to be picked up by the coil car.
•	More code was added and the coil car moved into position and the hydraulic lifter (Coil Car) picked up the pallet.
•	Unfortunately this was where the luck ran out for the day, as the coil car began to move off again and the pallet did not move with it. (Unity Physics not working)
•	Took a video of the problem and will send it to the other organization (SMS) and see if they know what the problem is.
17/03/2017
•	Started project plan for Latrobe University
•	Sorted out what paperwork will be required on Monday for City Hall. 
•	Completed the Fraunhofer curruption test.


20/03/2017
•	Today I will get a German bank account and a residence permit from the City of Kaiserslautern.
•	Provided the bank with my Australian tax file number
•	Also learnt some history about Kaiserslautern and how the Emperor of Kaiserslautern once caught a fish 5 metres  long and now it’s the emblem of Kaiserslautern, I think he had one too many Fosters.
21/03/2017
•	Had a skype meeting with Robert & Peter, Peter still thinks Germany is better than Australia, he obviously never had German sausages they are the Wurst......
 
•	Also need to contact Zia and Thomas about company sensitive information.
•	Successfully got a German bank account, residence permit and health insurance, still have to pay for TV/Radio connection even though I don’t have TV.
•	Also have passed all of these details onto Petra Wulff, unsure whether we need a German tax file number.
•	Today i was back in the Lab, for some reason the problem that occurred on the 16/03 suddenly is no longer a problem.
• 	So current situation is; A pallet is carrying an aluminium coil, it moves from platform 21 to platform 23 & 24. Then the coil car picks up both items and carries them towards the spool or mandrel as the Germans call it.
•	Zia is working on a function which sorts real numbers into integers, so we can read the actual position of coil car. 
•	Lately anything that requires real number conversion we just hardcoded.
•	Created a header file filed with defines, also commented and neaten the all the code.
22/03/2017
•	Today we will test Zia's real number function
•	It worked successfully, so if we enter a number for speed as an integer it will convert it to a real number.  
•	The factory received a massive update from SMS group, the factory now has an operational rotation platform, table shift platform
•	As well as readable lasers and the coil cars have more variables.	
•	Pablo and Andrea visited our Lab, we gave them a demonstration of the factory's capabilities so far.
	They are about to start work on another aspect of the larger BaSys40 project, I wrote them a small function so they have some sample code to analyse.
• 	Most of our C code needs to be rewritten as the variable names have been changed and we will use the lasers to our advantage instead of time delays which was a little unreliable.
•	We also tested some of the new turn tables and they have glitches hopefully we can fix them tomorrow.
23/03/2017
•	German classes were quite an experience, the teacher speaks German the whole time so have you have no idea what she is saying. Although we did learn some numbers, alphabet letters and greetings.
•	SMS group will hopefully show us how the coil cars work today and why there are glitches when transporting the pallet. 
•	Today was very busy, we did not have a chance to contact SMS group, instructions changed multiple times.
•	I was working on learning the new factory update and creating a whole new header file, so far I can book in a pallet and coil and move it. I cannot read a laser yet.	
•	Objectives changed after lunch, the new objective is to just create a small function that moves a pallet from one platform to the other. Then integrate this function into an architecture called Feral.
•	Java and Eclipse also need to be installed so we connected the internet to the servers and started installing programs.
24/03/2017 
•	Had a fair bit of trouble installing Eclipse and Java today although we worked how to successfully read a laser.
•	One number was causing all the problems, 4 instead of 3……
•	Also worked on project plan 


27/03/2017
•	Today we managed to install and remove the remaining installation errors from FERAL.
•	Stared writing the code program to interface feral and SMS together.
•	I have an greater understanding of why we are using Feral now, must remember to draw up a diagram illustrating how it works 
•	Also worked on my project plan
•	The $13000 mini factory arrived, will be used at a show next year, I might get to experiment with it. 
•	Will stay in my new apartment tonight.
28/03/2017
•	The apartment has a really nice view of Kaiserslautern, should upload a photo onto Facebook with #Innovation #IEEE

•	Located all the header files and make files, put them all in the same folder so everything links
•	It turns out FERAL is written in Java and might require a JNI or JNA 
•	This topic requires more research, will speak to Dr. Thomas Kuhn on 30th about it.
29/03/2017
•	Continued working on my project plan
•	FERAL is not working
•	I now have a bike but with a flat front tyre. 
30/03/2017
•	Discussed FERAL with Dr Thomas Kuhn, he also read over my draft project plan I need to change a couple of things. The Germans like to be very precise, maybe that is why they make good engineers.
•	Went to the Foreigners office, my residence permit is now glue in my passport.
•	Also have sorted my rent to automatically be paid every month.
•	A few more problems have been solved with FERAL but it is still not working properly. 
31/03/2017
•	Today was good successful day to end the week, FERAL now works and we can control Speed & On/Off of the platforms through FERAL
•	I expect next week we will use FERAL to its full potential because right now it seems we have just made things more complicated.
• 	Also finally learnt how to move the new Coil Car, SMS group have added a hydraulic chamber to it which makes it more complex.


03/04/2017
•	Finished my project Plan over the weekend and submitted it to LMS this morning.
•	Have incorparated the laser in FERAL but Feral is calling the function in C too quickly so the pallet doesn't reach the lasers before it times out
•	I will create pictures to better explain my progress.
04/04/2017
•	Zia and Dr Andreas Morggenstern are working on a state machine in the feral acrhitecture which will call the C functions
•	While this is happening i am learning about makefiles, as my job mainly is working with C files.

•	They're rumours going around Fraunhofer IESE that i'm the next 'Dennis Ritchie'.
05/04/2017
•	Today more i installed more feral components onto Eclipse, in preparation for the state machine.
•	I extended the simulation time in Eclipse and now my c function works perfectly.
•	Now the pallet and coil spawns on PE021 and travels to PE023, stopping when the last laser beam is broken.
06/04/2017
•	The state machine has been installed on eclipse but does not work properly
•	I have to wait for state machine to be fixed before i can continue my work in lab, apprently some decisions need to be made higher up.
•	While i am waiting, i am writing more c files which will add functionality to factory and learnong more about makefiles.
