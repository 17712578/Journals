08/03/2017
•	Had Teleco meeting with Peter, Dr. Thomas Kuhn and Ash
•	Signed contracts, roughly 8 hours per day required, I have copy for myself and the university.
•	Met my demonstrator ‘Zia Zhang’ we will be working on the BaSys40 project together.
•	Went to the downstairs lab, learnt how to power up and shut down the severs
•	Used Putty to start up Mat Lab equations on the server, then displayed the full factory layout on TV
•	The aim of this project is to move the Aluminum Coils around the factory.
•	Was able to manually move the coils and also change speed and direction.
09/03/2017
•	Read the factory manual, translated some German names of the factory into English.
•	In the future the factory may advance to a stage where the coils are rolled out. This rolling process is critical, as thickness, temperature, and number of remaining stitches must be taken into consideration when rolling the Aluminum. 
•	Read the driver manual, See technical journal for details.
•	Discovered which variables are linked to the Platforms, Coil car and Coil lifter.
•	Still unable to find how to move the slide platform, read LED variables and move the Coil Car.
10/03/2017
•	Worked out how to convert the Pallet Name and Location into a decimal number using the Ascii table.
•	Started working out different numbers required to hardcode.
•	Tested some of these numbers by manually entering them into the machine, successfully booked in a pallet and moved it in both directions
•	Started writing code so it ready to test next week. 


13/03/2017
•	Today the reflective memory got connected to the embedded server, which allows compiling of C programs on the embedded server
•	More variables were also added to the system in a update from SMS group.
•	Compiled the prepared code from last week, only a couple of errors.
•	Fixed the code and successfully executed it, A pallet was loaded into the system and moved across the platform.
14/03/2017
•	Inspected house today and the new accommodation is sorted.
•	Today's task was to make my code more efficient, both versions shall be kept in the technical journal
•	Had an error in the Byte Swap Function that was still unsolved at the end of the day.
15/03/2017
•	Solved the error in the Byte Swap Function and merged the function into the main code
•	Another problem arose when we tried to compile it in the Lab, apparently the machine runs on C89 and not C99 forcing us to make some minor adjustments.
•	Eventually this was sorted and a pallet was loaded into the system, this time the name and location was determined by typing it into CMD on the machine rather than the laptop.
•	Turned on a platform and stopped it after a certain amount of time, a couple of minor timing adjustments will result in the pallet stopping in the correct place.
16/03/2017
•	Today Dr. Kuhn promised us Football tickets to the FC Kaiserslautern game.
•	Was notified people are coming from Tokyo to see our factory in April 24th 
•	Fixed the timing adjustments from yesterday, now the pallet moves into the correct position ready to be picked up by the coil car.
•	More code was added and the coil car moved into position and the hydraulic lifter (Coil Car) picked up the pallet.
•	Unfortunately this was where the luck ran out for the day, as the coil car began to move off again and the pallet did not move with it. (Unity Physics not working)
•	Took a video of the problem and will send it to the other organization (SMS) and see if they know what the problem is.
17/03/2017
•	Started project plan for Latrobe University
•	Sorted out what paperwork will be required on Monday for City Hall. 
•	Completed the Fraunhofer curruption test.


20/03/2017
•	Today I will get a German bank account and a residence permit from the City of Kaiserslautern.
•	Provided the bank with my Australian tax file number
•	Also learnt some history about Kaiserslautern and how the Emperor of Kaiserslautern once caught a fish 5 metres  long and now it’s the emblem of Kaiserslautern, I think he had one too many Fosters.
21/03/2017
•	Had a skype meeting with Robert & Peter, Peter still thinks Germany is better than Australia, he obviously never had German sausages they are the Wurst......
 
•	Also need to contact Zia and Thomas about company sensitive information.
•	Successfully got a German bank account, residence permit and health insurance, still have to pay for TV/Radio connection even though I don’t have TV.
•	Also have passed all of these details onto Petra Wulff, unsure whether we need a German tax file number.
•	Today i was back in the Lab, for some reason the problem that occurred on the 16/03 suddenly is no longer a problem.
• 	So current situation is; A pallet is carrying an aluminium coil, it moves from platform 21 to platform 23 & 24. Then the coil car picks up both items and carries them towards the spool or mandrel as the Germans call it.
•	Zia is working on a function which sorts real numbers into integers, so we can read the actual position of coil car. 
•	Lately anything that requires real number conversion we just hardcoded.
•	Created a header file filed with defines, also commented and neaten the all the code.
22/03/2017
•	Today we will test Zia's real number function
•	It worked successfully, so if we enter a number for speed as an integer it will convert it to a real number.  
•	The factory received a massive update from SMS group, the factory now has an operational rotation platform, table shift platform
•	As well as readable lasers and the coil cars have more variables.	
•	Pablo and Andrea visited our Lab, we gave them a demonstration of the factory's capabilities so far.
	They are about to start work on another aspect of the larger BaSys40 project, I wrote them a small function so they have some sample code to analyse.
• 	Most of our C code needs to be rewritten as the variable names have been changed and we will use the lasers to our advantage instead of time delays which was a little unreliable.
•	We also tested some of the new turn tables and they have glitches hopefully we can fix them tomorrow.
23/03/2017
•	German classes were quite an experience, the teacher speaks German the whole time so have you have no idea what she is saying. Although we did learn some numbers, alphabet letters and greetings.
•	SMS group will hopefully show us how the coil cars work today and why there are glitches when transporting the pallet. 
•	Today was very busy, we did not have a chance to contact SMS group, instructions changed multiple times.
•	I was working on learning the new factory update and creating a whole new header file, so far I can book in a pallet and coil and move it. I cannot read a laser yet.	
•	Objectives changed after lunch, the new objective is to just create a small function that moves a pallet from one platform to the other. Then integrate this function into an architecture called Feral.
•	Java and Eclipse also need to be installed so we connected the internet to the servers and started installing programs.
24/03/2017 
•	Had a fair bit of trouble installing Eclipse and Java today although we worked how to successfully read a laser.
•	One number was causing all the problems, 4 instead of 3……
•	Also worked on project plan 


27/03/2017
•	Today we managed to install and remove the remaining installation errors from FERAL.
•	Stared writing the code program to interface feral and SMS together.
•	I have an greater understanding of why we are using Feral now, must remember to draw up a diagram illustrating how it works 
•	Also worked on my project plan
•	The $13000 mini factory arrived, will be used at a show next year, I might get to experiment with it. 
•	Will stay in my new apartment tonight.
28/03/2017
•	The apartment has a really nice view of Kaiserslautern, should upload a photo onto Facebook with #Innovation #IEEE

•	Located all the header files and make files, put them all in the same folder so everything links
•	It turns out FERAL is written in Java and might require a JNI or JNA 
•	This topic requires more research, will speak to Dr. Thomas Kuhn on 30th about it.
29/03/2017
•	Continued working on my project plan
•	FERAL is not working
•	I now have a bike but with a flat front tyre. 
30/03/2017
•	Discussed FERAL with Dr Thomas Kuhn, he also read over my draft project plan I need to change a couple of things. The Germans like to be very precise, maybe that is why they make good engineers.
•	Went to the Foreigners office, my residence permit is now glue in my passport.
•	Also have sorted my rent to automatically be paid every month.
•	A few more problems have been solved with FERAL but it is still not working properly. 
31/03/2017
•	Today was good successful day to end the week, FERAL now works and we can control Speed & On/Off of the platforms through FERAL
•	I expect next week we will use FERAL to its full potential because right now it seems we have just made things more complicated.
• 	Also finally learnt how to move the new Coil Car, SMS group have added a hydraulic chamber to it which makes it more complex.


03/04/2017
•	Finished my project Plan over the weekend and submitted it to LMS this morning.
•	Have incorparated the laser in FERAL but Feral is calling the function in C too quickly so the pallet doesn't reach the lasers before it times out
•	I will create pictures to better explain my progress.
04/04/2017
•	Zia and Dr Andreas Morggenstern are working on a state machine in the feral acrhitecture which will call the C functions
•	While this is happening i am learning about makefiles, as my job mainly is working with C files.

•	They're rumours going around Fraunhofer IESE that i'm the next 'Dennis Ritchie'.
05/04/2017
•	Today more i installed more feral components onto Eclipse, in preparation for the state machine.
•	I extended the simulation time in Eclipse and now my c function works perfectly.
•	Now the pallet and coil spawns on PE021 and travels to PE023, stopping when the last laser beam is broken.
06/04/2017
•	The state machine has been installed on eclipse but does not work properly
•	I have to wait for state machine to be fixed before i can continue my work in lab, apprently some decisions need to be made higher up.
•	While i am waiting, i am writing more c files which will add functionality to factory and learning more about makefiles.
07/04/2017
•	Recieved a german tax file 
•	Worked on the new header file, which includes read and write for platforms (refer to technical journal for more details).

Weekend: Helped Kaiserslautern Fc win 2:0,

10/04/2017
•	Last week was pretty slow, mainly due to the state machine not working and for the last two days my demostrator was away.
•	My aim for this is to help get the state machine working in anyway possible and have it cycle thru 5 states by the end of the week.
•	Finished the new Header file, almost 400 lines of variables
•	A team from marketing visit our laboraty, they will select wether our Demostartor will be in next month's exhibition.
•	State machine still does'nt work and the main software acrhitecture man is away for 2 weeks.....
•	I have written 5 C Files in preparation for when it does work

11/04/2017
•	I will write more C files and test them today.
•	So i have written another 15 C files, except this time they are more like functions because i have combined them into one file.
•	I have made a imaginary statemachine in C so i can test all the separate funtions together. (refer to technical journal for more details).
•	All 15 platforms work well expext the Rotation table, i should be able to sort that out tomorrow.
•	There are a couple errors in my new header file

12/04/2017
•	Still finding a couple of errors in the header file  
•	Almost got the rotational table to work
•	The new Coil Car almost works as well
•	I think i have added every required platform into the C program

13/04/2017
•	Dr Kuhn has found the error with the statemachine, hopefully it gets fixed next week.
•	Had my first meeting with Markus, Pablo, Thomas and Zai in the Laboratory.  
•	I showed what functionality i have achieved so far, everyone was pleased with my progess.
•	I still have a few minor problems such, rotational table still doesnt work (it has to be perfect), the two coil cars share the same variable in my header file and my coil car funtion is not perfect.
•	So since it is the Easter break tomorrow, i looked at my plan schedule to see how i am tracking. 
•	Since the goals have changed it is a bit hard to tell but i believe i ahead of schedule by about three weeks!

Easter Break

18/04/2017
•	Today's goal is to fix my coil car function and the error in the header file.
•	My Demostator is aiming to get the Statemachine working by the end of the day.
•	The real Statemachine finally works and i have adjusted my Coil Car function so it now works better.
•	Over the next couple of days more of my statemachine (C based) will be moved into the new statemachine (Java based).

19/04/2017
•	continued working on the new statemachine.	
•	Experiemented with what would happen if the lasers were broken, could time be used as a subsitute.

20/04/2017
•	Some more decisions have been made higher up, meaning i have to change my code again 
•	Also worked on documentation 
21/04/2017
• 	So the decision has been made that we will no longer use C language, all files\functions will be written in groovy (Java Hybird) 

24/04/2017
• 	Wrote components for shift table in groovy   (see technical journal)
25/04/2017
•	wrote components for coil car in groovy	     (see technical journal)
26/04/2017
•	wrote components for part 3 in groovy	     (see technical journal)
•	Starting writing PID for rotation table in C

27/04/2017
•	Finished writing PID for rotation table in C, tested it works perfectly (see technical journal)
•	Will starting writing it in groovy
•	SMS have installed an update that removes a few glitches

•	As its Friday we had our acrhitecture meeting the main points were:
•	New architecture design has been given all clear by other teams
•	A porposal has been put forward by Thomas, on what is the minimum amount of information required to describe a singular device
•	I have been assigned a new task of creating digital twins!!
•	I shall do some planning over the long weekend, the next couple of weeks will be exciting but challenging

05/06/2017
•	public holiday
06/06/2017
•	Disigned flowchart for digital twins
•	Wrote a file which stores variables
•	Attended a birthday party at work..
•	Made a decision to use Array list instead of linked list as they have quicker access time
07/06/2017
•	Started writing the main component for digital twins
•	Includes array map of the factory
•	Message receiving function
•	Scan area function
•	and light  barrier logic

16/06/2017
•	Discussed my Industry 4.0 report with Markus, Fixed some of the technical aspects
•	Markus also gave a great example of data secuity issues that are just starting to arise now because of new technology 
•		So Fraunhofer IESE has many printers which its employees can print too, however it does not own these
		printers or have to perform maintenance on the printers either. Fraunhofer has an agreement with a printer
		company that charge Fraunhofer per page. So for the printer company to know how much Fraunhofer has printed they 
		gather information from the printers. However that information might also include what excatly Fraunhofer is printing,
		giving the printer company insight into fraunhofer's business. Which Fraunhofer would prefer to keep secert. 

26/06/2017
•	Started filming 
27/06/2017
•	Showed the SMS Demonstrator to Honorable Dr.Peter Moar....
•	Answered interview questions and partisapated in B-roll filming
28/06/2017
•	Zia is leaving for 2 weeks holiday, so we had meeting discussing what i should do while she is away.
•
29/06/2017
•	Added feature which returns the shift table back
•	Need to contact SMS Group and tell them adjust the lightbarrier (laser) position, shift table overshoots position
•	Found out how to change the name of the pallet 
•	Need to create more Line controllers so behaviors can be ran in parallel 

03/07/2017
•	Started making more behaviors, so now platforms will be more individualised rather than clumped togehter 
•	Had to change SMSInformationModel( Where all the ports are Stored) and the main controller	
04/07/2017
•	Started testing simulation 
•	Found an error on PE033, lightbarriers are incorrectly labelled  
•	So far new behaviors can only work in one direction
05/07/2017
•	Control belt behaviors are operational in both directions 
•	Tried to make LineController control speed of the motors, did not work
•	Successfully booked in Two pallets and Coil automactically 
•	Although i have a problem. Pallet1 travels fine until it reaches where pallet2 started, it then stops there.
06/07/2017
•	Fixed problem occuring on PE033
•	Updated project to SVN project, this had not been done for a long time
•	Finally found the solution to the major problem!!
•	The problem was inside the behaviors, The FSM inside these behaviors was not returning to its original state. 
07/07/2017
•	Attempted to link digital twins  to line controller (Not complete at the end of the day)
•	Fixed another error with the platform 16 but unsure why the solutions works
•	Attend Friday meeting:
	Dr Kuhn recommend having one LineController and multiple Palletcontrollers for the pallets
	I am also allow to change the names of the beltcontroller to make them easier to understand
•	Now beginning renaming stuff and neating code, Dr Kuhn is happy with the progress. 

10/07/2017
•	Still in Paris
11/07/2017
•	Starting to design product controllers, this will take a while.
12/07/2017
•	Something is wrong with Platform PE016 again 
•	Making some progress on the new design, now have 1 pallet on the factory floor
•	Will attempt to make instances of product controller everytime a pallet is loaded to the factory floor 
•	What was wrong with the old design:
	Everytime a product needed to be controlled, a new linecontroller would be connected into the system (A fair amount of code)
	Now there will only be one linecontroller, that feed mutltiples instance of product control (Still one file just run as different instances) 
13/07/2017
•	Making instances of the same behevior is not possible
•	Fixed other odds and ends, except PE016 which is getting really annoying.
14/07/2017
•	This morning i recieved news that two demostrations were required in the afternoon
•	The first one was to university students, did'nt go that well as glitches appeared in the system during presentation
•	This one was not very important and no one really cared.
•	The second presentation was important!!! The boss of Fraunhofer was there (highest person in fraunhofer)!
•	There also many chinese people, so Zai had to translate in chinese for them.
•	No glitches appeared while presenting and for the first time ever two pallets were successfully presented!
•	and everyone lived happily ever after. 
•	Weekend time!

17/07/2017 
•	Quite a slow day because i did'nt breakfast due to there being no milk
•	Finally after several attempts got a productController to communicate with a DigitalTwin 
•	So now the second pallet will wait til the first pallet get to certain checkpoints
•	I have create a delayBehavior aswell
18/07/2017 
•	Had breakfast today
•	Added more comments to the code
•	Myself and Zai worked together to create only one positionCalculator file for ever pallet, also variables are no longer hardcoded but come from the main controller. 
•	This worked but new connections are still required everytime the file is used.
•	Trying now to redo the communication between productController to communicate with a DigitalTwin(positonCalculator)
19/07/2017 
•	Markus and Robert have both read my Industrie 4.0 project and given me feedback
•	So i spent today on rewriting part of my report, i can also use some these parts in my thesis 
•	Had potatoes again for lunch, that will be the last time for a while....
•	Zai said she will discuss our error on the SMSDemostrator with Dr Kuhn tomorrow
