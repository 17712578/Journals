•	Had Teleco meeting with Peter, Patrick, Dr Thomas and Ash
•	Signed contracts, roughly 8 hour days required, I have copy for myself and the university.
•	Met my demonstrator ‘Zia’ we will be working on the BaSys40 project together.
•	Went to the downstairs lab, learnt how to power up and shut down the severs
•	Used Putty to start up in built MabLab equations, then displayed the full factory layout on Tv
•	The aim of this project is to move the alumina rolls around the factory.
•	Was able to manually move the coil, changed speed and direction.
09/03/2017
•	Read the factory manual, translated some German names of the factory to English.
•	The factory has possibility to advance into a rolling process this part is critical. As thickness, temperature, and number of remaining stitches must be taken into consideration when rolling the aluminium. 
•	Read the driver manual, See technical journal for details.
•	Discovered which variables are linked to the Platforms, Coil car and Coil lifter.
•	Still unable to find how to move slide control, read LED variables or move coil loaders.
10/03/2017
•	Worked out how to convert the Pallet Name and Location into a decimal number using the Ascii table.
•	Started working out numbers required for code.
•	Tested some of these numbers by manually entering them into the machine, successfully Bookin a pallet and moved it in both directions
•	Started writing code so it ready to test next week. 
13/03/2017
•	Today the reflective memory got connected to the embedded server, which allows compiling of C programs on the embedded server
•	More variables were also added to the system.
•	Compiled the prepared code from last week, only a couple of errors.
•	Once fixed the code successfully excuted, A pallet was loaded into the system and moved across.
14/03/2017
•	Inspected house today and accoommodation is sorted
•	Today's task was to make my code more efficient, the different verison shall be kept in the technical journal
•	Had an error in the swapFunction that was still unsolved at the end of the day.
15/03/2017
•	Sovled error in Swapfunction and Incorparated it into the main code
•	Another problem arose when we tried to compile it in the Lab, apprently the machine runs on C89 and not C99. Forcing us to make some minor adjustments
•	Eventually this was sorted and a pallet was loaded into the system, this time the name and location was determined by typing it in from the interface.
•	Turned on a platform and stopped it after a certain amount of time, a couple of minior timing adjustments will result in the pallet stopping in the correct place.
16/03/2017
•	Today Dr Kuhn promised us Football tickets to the FC Kaiserslautern game.
•	Was notified people are coming from Toyko to see our factory in April 24th 
•	Fixed the timing adjustments from yesterday, now the pallet moves into the correct position ready to be picked up by the coil car.
•	More code was added and the coil car moved into poisiton and the hydraulic lifter picked up the pallet.
•	Unfortunelty this was where the luck ran out for today, as the coil car began to move off again and the pallet did not move with it.
•	Took a video of the problem and will send it to the other organisation (SMS) and see thay know what the problem is.
