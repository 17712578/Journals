•	Read the factory manual, translated some German names of the factory to English.
•	The factory has possibility to advance into a rolling process this part is critical. As thickness, temperature, and number of remaining stitches must be taken into consideration when rolling the aluminium. 
•	Read the driver manual, See technical journal for details.
•	Discovered which variables are linked to the Platforms, Coil car and Coil lifter.
•	Still unable to find how to move slide control, read LED variables or move coil loaders.
